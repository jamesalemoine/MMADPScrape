Program to scrape MMA Modern and Contemporary Paintings and Sculpture metadata

README: This class exercise seeks to retrieve metadata related to twentieth and twenty-first century paintings and sculpture acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The end goal is to obtain the raw data, normalize it using OpenRefine, and visualize the data to facilitate trend detection in two areas: the institutional collecting history; and the collection's ability to reflect the ongoing trajectory of modern and contemporary art.
