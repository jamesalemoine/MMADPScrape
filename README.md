Program to scrape MMA Drawings and Prints (1600-1800) metadata

README: This is a class exercise that seeks to obtain metadata related to European Baroque and Rococo drawings and prints acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art since its inception in the late nineteenth century.
The end goal is to obtain the raw data, normalize it using OpenRefine, and visualize the data using TableauPublic software to facilitate trend detection in two areas: the institutional collecting history; and the historical trajectory of European printmaking and draftsmanship.
