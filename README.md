Python program to scrape MMA Modern and Contemporary Paintings and Sculpture metadata

README: This exercise seeks to retrieve metadata related to twentieth and twenty-first century paintings and sculpture acquired by The Metropolitan Museum of Art, specifically works housed by the Modern and Contemporary Art department. The goal is to obtain and normalize the raw data and visualize it to facilitate trend detection in two areas: the institutional collecting history; and the collection's ability to reflect the ongoing trajectory of modern and contemporary art history and practice.

[N.B. The name "MMADPScrape" is a retained remnant of this project's previous iteration.]
